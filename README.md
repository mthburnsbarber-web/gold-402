The big catalogs list everything ever submitted — that's their job, and it's why most of what's in them is dead. We measured it: **67–79% of the free-listing catalogs no longer answer.**

gold-402 is the other thing. Smaller on purpose. A person checked every entry, we publish what we checked and what we didn't, and in July 2026 we started **buying services and reporting what came back**. Automated monitors now do the machine half of that continuously and do it well; what they do not do — by their own published scope — is judge whether the thing that came back was any good. That judgement is what this list is.

## The Directory

The product. 459 entries across 13 shelves, in [`directory/`](directory/).

| Shelf | What's on it |
|---|---|
| [APIs & Services](directory/apis.md) | Paid endpoints an agent can call. Every one probed for a live 402 before listing. |
| [MCP Servers](directory/mcp-servers.md) | Model Context Protocol servers — utility, crypto, security, identity, escrow, discovery. |
| [SDKs & Libraries](directory/sdks.md) | Client and server libraries across languages. |
| [Facilitators](directory/facilitators.md) | Payment verification and settlement services. |
| [Frameworks](directory/frameworks.md) | Agent frameworks with x402 support. |
| [Tools](directory/tools.md) | CLIs, CI, monitoring, spend controls, testing, discovery. |
| [Security](directory/security.md) | Audit, risk scoring, pre-execution gates, compliance. |
| [Ecosystem](directory/ecosystem.md) | Protocol, infrastructure, wallets, orchestration, marketplaces. |
| [Aggregators & Proxies](directory/aggregators.md) | One integration, many upstreams — services that unify or resell access to other providers' APIs and data. |
| [**The Global Agent Economy**](directory/global.md) | **China, India, Korea — infrastructure no English-language directory indexes.** |
| [Learning](directory/learning.md) | Quickstarts, tutorials, reference docs, news. |
| [Community](directory/community.md) | Channels, newsletters, jobs, events. |
| [Market Data](directory/market-data.md) | On-chain analytics, dashboards, adoption. |

## What "verified" means here

One tier: **listed = verified.** No bronze, silver, gold.

If an entry is on the list, a maintainer confirmed the endpoint was live and answered an x402 request correctly at review, and we re-check periodically. That is the whole claim.

**It is not** an audit of the provider, a guarantee of uptime, or a promise any given call will succeed.

**Some entries carry more.** Where we have paid for a service and confirmed what came back, we say so and keep the receipt — what we sent, what it cost, the transaction hash, what arrived. That's a stronger claim and we only make it about services we actually bought. Most of the list hasn't been through that yet, and we'd rather say so than imply otherwise.

## Ecosystem Data

Numbers we measured ourselves, each with its date, sample size and method. Where measurements disagree, both are shown — they were taken on different days by different methods, and blending them into one tidy figure would be the kind of thing this directory exists to argue against.

### How much of the ecosystem is alive

| Measured | Population | Live | Dead | Method |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07 | 22,545 CDP Bazaar services | 5,792 | **74%** | full probe crawl, valid 402 required |
| 2026-07-10 | 25,614 catalog services | 5,344 | **79%** | catalog snapshot, verify-state carried forward |
| 2026-07-29 | 24,583 catalog services | — | **~67%** | earlier full crawl, cited in the liveness study |

Three runs, three numbers, one direction: **the large free-listing catalogs are majority dead, and have been all month.** Anyone quoting a single decimal-point figure for this is quoting a moment, not a fact.

### Liveness is predicted by listing friction

Across four independent registries — 204,500 registered agents and services — the dead share tracks one variable: what it costs to get listed.

| Registry | Entry cost | Dead |
|---|---|---|
| CDP Bazaar | free | ~67–79% |
| ERC-8004 on-chain identity | gas only | 85–97% |
| Glama MCP registry | curation + scoring | 47% unhealthy _(their own published figure)_ |

**Free entry selects for abandonment.** Full method, limits, and an open invitation to refute it: [The Liveness Law →](articles/2026-07-the-liveness-law.md)

### Buying is harder than finding

In July 2026 we ran a paid delivery check across our own shelf — actually buying services and recording what came back.

- **16** of 126 listed services were purchasable by a machine at a discoverable address
- **8** delivered exactly what they advertised
- **0** took payment and returned nothing
- **$0.054** spent, every transaction reconciled on-chain

The friction in this economy sits **before** the payment, not after it. Most services are fine; most front doors are not. A larger sample is in progress before we make a claim of it.

### Coverage beyond the West

x402 is a US-governed rail. It is not the only answer to machine payment, and outside the West it is not the answer being used — China runs delegated agent authorization on existing rails, India runs regulated human-signed mandates that agents execute inside a cap. Both were operating at scale before the x402 Foundation was a month old.

We index that world too, including surfaces no English-language directory carries: [The Global Agent Economy →](directory/global.md)

_All figures above are ours and reproducible. Where we could not reach something, we say so rather than leaving the gap invisible._

## Quick Start

> **New to x402?** Three steps to your first payment.

**1. Pick a facilitator**

| Use case | Facilitator |
|----------|-------------|
| Most chains, full SDK support | [Coinbase CDP](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402) |
| Edge deployment, global latency | [Cloudflare x402](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/x402) |
| Enterprise billing + disputes | [Stripe Machine Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/machine/x402) |

**2. Install the SDK**

```bash
# TypeScript
npm install @coinbase/x402-express

# Python
pip install x402

# Rust
cargo add x402
```

**3. Add payment middleware**

```typescript
import { paymentMiddleware } from '@coinbase/x402-express';

app.use(paymentMiddleware(wallet, {
  '/api/data': { price: '$0.01', network: 'base-mainnet' }
}));
```

That's it. The middleware returns 402 with payment details, verifies the client's payment header, and lets the request through.

## How x402 Works

```
1. Client  →  GET /api/data                              (initial request)
2. Server  ←  402 Payment Required                       (payment details in header)
               X-Payment-Required: {amount, address, network}
3. Client  →  EIP-3009 gasless USDC transfer             (client signs + submits)
4. Client  →  GET /api/data  +  X-Payment: {signed tx}  (retry with payment)
5. Facilitator  →  verify + settle on-chain              (~2 seconds)
6. Server  ←  200 OK  +  X-Payment-Response              (resource returned)
```

No gas for the sender. No subscription. No API key. Payment IS authentication.

## Need More?

This README is the front door. The full curated directory — every shelf, every entry — is in [`directory/`](directory/).

**Other lists worth knowing:** the community [awesome-x402](https://github.com/x402-foundation/awesome-x402) accepts everything and is the right place for exhaustive coverage. [Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers) indexes MCP servers at enormous scale and publishes its own health data, which is rarer than it should be. Different jobs. Use all three.

## Contributing

gold-402 is curated, not exhaustive. Every entry earns its place.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the curation standard, badge system, acceptance criteria, and submission process.

**Quick rules:**
- Entry must use the x402 protocol (HTTP 402 + X-Payment), not just USDC or general crypto payments.
- Live URL or public GitHub repo. Link must work.
- Last activity within 12 months (for libraries and resources without a live endpoint).
- One entry per pull request. Format: `[Name](url) — Description starting uppercase, ending with period.`
- Descriptions are factual. No marketing language.
